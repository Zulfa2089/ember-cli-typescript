You can simply `ember install` the dependency like normal:

```sh
ember install ember-cli-typescript@latest
```

All dependencies will be added to your `package.json`, and you're ready to roll! **If you're upgrading from a previous release, see below!** you should check to merge any tweaks you've made to `tsconfig.json`.

## Installation Results
